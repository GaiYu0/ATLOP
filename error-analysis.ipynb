They are commonly known as \u001b[31mWood - elves\u001b[0m . In the \u001b[31mFirst Age\u001b[0m the \u001b[31mElves\u001b[0m of \u001b[31mOssiriand\u001b[0m , or \u001b[31mLaiquendi\u001b[0m , were also referred to as wood - elves . \u001b[31mSilvan Elves\u001b[0m are mainly \u001b[31mNandor\u001b[0m in descent but also mixed with \u001b[31mAvari\u001b[0m . Many of them were later ruled over by a small population of social elites who were \u001b[31mSindar\u001b[0m ( \u001b[31mGrey Elves\u001b[0m ) or even \u001b[31mNoldor\u001b[0m ( \u001b[31mHigh Elves\u001b[0m ) . For example , \u001b[31mThranduil\u001b[0m king of northern \u001b[31mMirkwood\u001b[0m , as well as his son \u001b[31mLegolas\u001b[0m , were \u001b[31mSindarin Elves\u001b[0m who ruled over a primarily \u001b[31mSilvan\u001b[0m population . Similarly \u001b[31mAmdír\u001b[0m and his son \u001b[31mAmroth\u001b[0m , the last \u001b[31mSindarin\u001b[0m prince of \u001b[31mLorien\u001b[0m , were \u001b[31mSindar\u001b[0m . After \u001b[31mAmroth\u001b[0m was lost at sea , \u001b[31mGaladriel\u001b[0m and \u001b[31mCeleborn\u001b[0m came to rule over \u001b[31mLórien\u001b[0m . \u001b[31mGaladriel\u001b[0m was a \u001b[31mHigh Elf\u001b[0m who belonged to the \u001b[31mHouse of Finarfin\u001b[0m , though she was actually of mixed \u001b[31mVanyar\u001b[0m / \u001b[31mNoldor\u001b[0m / \u001b[31mTelerin\u001b[0m parentage , while \u001b[31mCeleborn\u001b[0m was also \u001b[31mSindarin\u001b[0m ( \u001b[31mSindar\u001b[0m being a subset of the \u001b[31mTeleri\u001b[0m ) . \u001b[31mSilvan Elves\u001b[0m are described as being less wise than other \u001b[31mEldar\u001b[0m , and some of them are almost indistinguishable from the \u001b[31mAvari\u001b[0m , those who never joined the \u001b[31mGreat Journey\u001b[0m .\n",

      "\u001b[31mPiracy on Falcon Lake\u001b[0m refers to an increase in crime at the border between \u001b[31mthe United States\u001b[0m and \u001b[31mMexico\u001b[0m on \u001b[31mFalcon Lake\u001b[0m . The lake is a long reservoir of the \u001b[31mRio Grande\u001b[0m that was constructed in \u001b[31m1954\u001b[0m and is a known drug smuggling route . A turf war between rival drug cartels for control of the lake began in \u001b[31mMarch 2010\u001b[0m and has led to a series of armed robberies and shooting incidents . All of the attacks were credited to the \u001b[31mLos Zetas\u001b[0m cartel and occurred primarily on the \u001b[31mMexican\u001b[0m side of the reservoir but within sight of the \u001b[31mTexas\u001b[0m coast . The so - called pirates operate \" fleets \" of small boats designed to seize fisherman and smuggle drugs . While the events have been referred to colloquially as piracy , all the waters of \u001b[31mFalcon Lake\u001b[0m are considered either \u001b[31mUS\u001b[0m or \u001b[31mMexican\u001b[0m territorial waters and therefore are not technically piracy under Article 101 of the \u001b[31mUN Convention on the Law of the Sea\u001b[0m .\n",
